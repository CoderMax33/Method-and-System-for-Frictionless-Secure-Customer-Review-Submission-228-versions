Password-Protected Review URL System

© 2025 – All Rights Reserved by Gideon Stewan Kukard
Overview

This repository contains the full source code for an innovative passwordless authentication system designed for customer review platforms.
It allows verified customers to access and submit reviews without manually logging in or entering a password, while keeping the review page securely protected.

The system is capable of generating unique, secure URLs (and optionally QR codes) that embed authentication credentials directly.
When a customer uses the link or scans the code, the system validates the credentials and grants automatic access to the review form.
Key Features

    Passwordless Access – No need for customer accounts or manual password entry.

    228 Unique Implementations – Covers all known technical methods of secure auto-authentication.

    QR Code Integration – Links can be converted to QR codes for offline-to-online review collection.

    Multiple Security Layers – Supports encryption, token expiry, device fingerprinting, and multi-factor authentication.

    Flexible Delivery – Links can be sent via email, SMS, receipts, NFC tags, or displayed in-store.

    Business Control – Merchants can change their authentication credentials at any time to invalidate old links.

How It Works

    Business generates a password-protected review page.

    System creates a secure, URL-embedded credential (e.g., token, encrypted password).

    Business shares the link or QR code with a verified customer.

    Customer clicks or scans the link; the system extracts and validates the credential.

    If valid, the customer bypasses login and can write a review immediately.

Security Highlights

    Supports URL parameter, path, hash, and encoded payload credential delivery.

    Compatible with AES, JWT, Base64, HMAC, ROT13, and custom encryption methods.

    Can enforce one-time use, expiry times, and IP/device restrictions.

    Prevents non-customers from leaving reviews.
